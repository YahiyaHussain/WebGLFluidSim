# WebGLFluidSim

A collection of small 2D WebGL experiments meant to lead me someday to be able to do a liquid simulation.

Modules:
* Conway: draw on the screen with the mouse and press space to play conway's game of life
* StaticAdvection ctrl+v your favorite image and watch it get pushed down the drain by a vector field
* DynamicAdvection ctrl+v your favorite image and watch it get torn apart by a vector field that also acts on itself
* Everything else is just random rainbow colors meant to teach me something specific about WebGL
